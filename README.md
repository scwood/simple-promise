This is small [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com) implementation that I wrote to try and understand promises a little better. All tests pass and I tried to make it as understandable as possible!

See it in action:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scwood/simple-promise
cd simple-promise
npm install
npm test
```
